<h1>Samsung Galaxy Note II</h1>
<p>
The Samsung Galaxy Note II is an Android smartphone manufactured by Samsung and noted for its combination of a large display, 5.55-inch (141 mm) measured diagonally, and software optimized for an integral self-storing stylus. Because the display places the device at the large end of the smartphone and small end of the tablet size ranges, the Galaxy Note II has been called a hybrid of a phone and tablet, or phablet.
